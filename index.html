        <h2 id="AboutMe" class="BiographySubtitle">About Me</h2>
        <p class="BiographyDescription">I am passionate, driven, determined, and resilient. Who is eager to find new
            ways to expand my knowledge and grow through applying my critical thinking skills. Identifying a businesses'
            problems and finding solutions drives me to success!
            As a college student, I generated marketing plans and ran google ad campaigns using google analytics. I
            conducted my own research on the effects of socioeconomic status on consumer behavior and the psychological
            factors that contribute to impulsive buying. Additionally, I've discovered my passion for coding (i.e., html, css, and 
            javascript). As a passion project I have put together a <a href="https://dan1233212020.github.io/Resource-List/" target="_blank">resource website</a>
            for the Latin and Vietnemease community in the Orange County region. My long-term goals are to incorporate my critical 
            thinking skills with my technical skills in order to help create change and bring a solutional change to businesses' 
            and create entrepreneurship in collaboration with my partner <a href="PartnersWeb.html" target="_blank">Jacqueline</a>

            bring the two concepts together. My dream job is to work for either a small business, non-profit, or with
            young entrepreneurs. Through my education and passion to help others achieve their goals, I look to apply my
