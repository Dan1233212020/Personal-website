        <h2 class="BiographySubtitle">About Me</h2>
        <p class="BiographyDescription">I am passionate, driven, determined, and resilient. Who is eager to find new
            ways to expand my knowledge and grow through applying my critical thinking skills. Identifying a businesses'
            problems and finding solutions drives me to success!
            As a college student, I generated marketing plans and ran google ad campaigns using google analytics. I
            conducted my own research on the effects of socioeconomic status on consumer behavior and the psychological
            factors that contribute to impulsive buying.
